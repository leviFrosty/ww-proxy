# Agent guide — ww-proxy

This codebase is the backend API that powers the WitnessWork expo (react native) application found at ~/dev/witness-work.

A Cloudflare Workers API/proxy (HERE API, iOS universal links, Notes Import). See
`README.md` for general setup; this file documents agent-relevant operational
details, primarily the **environments**.

## Environments

There are two deployed Workers, defined in `wrangler.toml`:

| Env  | Worker name    | URL                                          | Deploy command        |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| prod | `ww-proxy`     | `https://ww-proxy.leviwilkerson.com`         | `pnpm run deploy`     |
| dev  | `ww-proxy-dev` | `https://ww-proxy-dev.<subdomain>.workers.dev` | `pnpm run deploy:dev` |

Prefer the `pnpm run deploy*` scripts over raw `wrangler deploy` — they also
inject the `SENTRY_RELEASE` var and upload source maps to Sentry (see
[Sentry source maps](#sentry-source-maps) below). CI (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
deploys prod on `v*` tags with the same source map upload.

`dev` is a **fully separate Worker** — its own name, KV namespace, rate-limit
namespace, secrets, and `workers.dev` URL. `wrangler deploy --env dev` can never
overwrite prod. Plain `wrangler deploy` always targets prod, so the `--env dev`
flag is the isolation boundary.

The dev worker exists for **real-device App Attest end-to-end testing**: it pins
to the dev iOS bundle id `com.leviwilkerson.jwtimedev` (from witness-work
`app.config.ts`, `IS_DEV` branch) and is the only place
`NOTES_IMPORT_DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN` should ever be set — **never on prod.**

Note: in Wrangler, `vars`, `kv_namespaces`, and `ratelimits` are **not inherited**
by a named env, so they are repeated under `[env.dev]` in `wrangler.toml`. Keep
them in sync with the top-level prod config when adding new bindings.

## Deploying to dev (one-time setup)

```bash
# 1. Create a dedicated dev KV namespace, then paste the printed id into
#    wrangler.toml under [[env.dev.kv_namespaces]] (replacing REPLACE_WITH_DEV_NOTES_KV_ID).
wrangler kv namespace create NOTES_KV --env dev

# 2. Set the dev worker's secrets (the --env dev flag keeps them off prod).
wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY --env dev
wrangler secret put REVENUECAT_API_KEY --env dev
wrangler secret put NOTES_IMPORT_DEV_BYPASS_TOKEN --env dev   # dev only
wrangler secret put ADMIN_API_TOKEN --env dev  # unique dev reset token
# Plus any other secrets prod uses that dev needs (HERE_API_KEY, SENTRY_DSN, ...).
# Production uses a different token: wrangler secret put ADMIN_API_TOKEN

# 3. Deploy.
wrangler deploy --env dev
```

After setup, redeploying dev is just:

```bash
pnpm run deploy:dev
```

## Local iteration (no deploy)

```bash
wrangler dev                 # local runtime
wrangler dev --remote --env dev   # Cloudflare edge with dev bindings
```

Neither gives a stable public URL for an iOS device — use the deployed
`--env dev` worker (or a `cloudflared` tunnel) for real-device App Attest tests.

## Notes Import runtime limits and admin reset

Allowance policy lives in each environment's `NOTES_KV` under
`notes-import:limits` and is edge-cached for 60 seconds. Its JSON shape is:

```json
{"importsFree":5,"importsSupporter":-1,"refinementsFree":5,"refinementsSupporter":-1,"windowDays":30}
```

Each field independently resolves KV → the matching `wrangler.toml` env var →
code default. Allowances accept integer `-1` (unlimited), `0` (none), or a
positive value; `windowDays` accepts any positive finite number, including
fractions for short dev windows.

To reset one meter's rolling aggregate and Empty Import rows while preserving
permanent replay/refinement records, copy `.env.example` to the gitignored
`.env`, set the environment-specific token/URL, then run:

```bash
pnpm run admin:reset-usage <meterId>         # production
pnpm run admin:reset-usage --dev <meterId>   # development
```

`ADMIN_API_TOKEN` and `ADMIN_API_TOKEN_DEV` must match separate Wrangler
`ADMIN_API_TOKEN` secrets in prod/dev. Never reuse the development bypass token.

## Checks before deploy

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
wrangler deploy --dry-run            # prod build
wrangler deploy --env dev --dry-run  # dev build
```

## Sentry source maps

Errors are reported with `release: SENTRY_RELEASE` (the git commit sha,
injected as a deploy-time var). The `pnpm run deploy` / `deploy:dev` scripts
build with `--outdir dist` and then run `pnpm run sentry:sourcemaps`, which
uploads `dist/` to Sentry tagged with that release so stack traces show
original TypeScript. Org/project defaults live in `.sentryclirc` (org
`levi-wilkerson`, project `ww-proxy`).

Auth: `sentry-cli` needs `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment — an org auth
token with source map upload (`project:releases`) scope, created at
https://levi-wilkerson.sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/. Locally export it in
your shell (or put it in `~/.sentryclirc`); in CI it is the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
repo secret. Never commit it.

`wrangler.toml` also sets `upload_source_maps = true` (inherited by
`[env.dev]`), so Cloudflare's own dashboard/tail stack traces are mapped even
on raw `wrangler deploy`.

## Backlog

- **Notes Import streaming / Durable Objects migration** — DONE (2026-06-23).
  The model run now streams from two SQLite Durable Objects (`NotesImportRun`
  per import, `NotesImportIndex` per user for the concurrency cap), via AI SDK
  v6 `streamText` + `Output.object`. Attested kickoff (`POST
  /notes-import/kickoff`) → SSE progress stream (`GET /notes-import/:id/events`)
  → result snapshot (`/result`); the legacy `POST /notes-import` remains as a
  fallback. First deploy applies the `v1` DO migration automatically (prod +
  `--env dev`). Reasoning is ON by default at `xhigh`
  (`NOTES_IMPORT_REASONING_EFFORT`) — on OpenRouter `deepseek-v4-flash` accepts
  only `high`/`xhigh`, and `xhigh` IS its max ("Think Max"); `max` is invalid
  there and coerced to `xhigh`. The model co-emits reasoning and strict
  structured output. A buggy ZDR-host parser can misroute the JSON into the
  reasoning channel (blank completion); the run DO recovers it, so reasoning
  stays on. `usage.reasoningTokens` is logged per run. Architecture + resolved
  decisions:
  [`docs/notes-import-streaming-durable-objects.md`](docs/notes-import-streaming-durable-objects.md).
