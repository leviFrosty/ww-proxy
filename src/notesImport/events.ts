/**
 * Notes Import progress stream — wire contract.
 *
 * This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what the client sees on the live import
 * channel. The stream exists SOLELY to keep the user informed that the model is
 * working (phase changes, optional reasoning, a heartbeat of output growth) — it
 * is never parsed for data. The authoritative structured result rides on the
 * single terminal `done` event (and is also fetchable via GET .../result), and
 * mirrors the legacy synchronous `POST /notes-import` response so the app's
 * apply logic is unchanged.
 *
 * Every event carries a monotonic `seq` (its SQLite rowid in the run DO) so a
 * client that drops and reconnects resumes with `Last-Event-ID` and never
 * replays an event it already applied.
