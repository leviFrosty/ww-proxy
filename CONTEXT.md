# ww-proxy — Notes Import

This repo is a Cloudflare Workers proxy hosting several unrelated features (HERE
API, iOS universal links, Notes Import). The only one with rich domain language
is **Notes Import** — the feature that turns a user's free-text field-service
notes into structured WitnessWork records. This glossary governs that feature
across both repos (`ww-proxy` backend + `witness-work` client).

## Language

### Core nouns

**Import**:
One submission of a user's free-text notes for parsing into structured records.
Its identity is the **content** (a hash of the notes) — resubmitting the same
text, or refining it, is the **same Import** and the same history row. One row in
the history list = one Import.
_Avoid_: job, session, request.

**Run handle** (`importId`):
The backend's internal handle for a single background model execution of an
Import. NOT the Import's identity — a Refinement is a new Run handle for the same
Import. The client only holds the *current* Run handle while an Import is
**Working** (to reconnect to it); it is meaningless once the Import is Ready/Done.
_Avoid_: treating importId as "the import" in user-facing terms.

**Refinement**:
A follow-up natural-language instruction that re-parses the **same** source notes
of an existing Import. A Refinement is a distinct parse but concerns the same
source text.
_Avoid_: edit, correction, retry (retry means re-running after a failure).

**Summary**:
A short (≤5 word) model-generated label for an Import, returned as a field on the
parse result (same model call) and used as its row title once the Import is
**Ready**. While **Working** (and after a cold-start resume), the row shows a
**provisional title** instead — a persisted first-line snippet of the notes. A
deterministic counts line ("3 contacts · 5 visits") is shown as a subtitle in any
state once a result exists.
_Avoid_: title (when ambiguous), name, description.

### Lifecycle states

An Import is always in exactly one of these. This is the canonical user-facing
vocabulary; the UI renders these, not the finer-grained backend run statuses.

**Working**:
The model is still parsing the Import; no result yet. A failed run is shown as an
error **within** the Working state (retry in place), not as a separate top-level
state. Two sub-states of Working are surfaced as labels (never as their own
top-level state): **Queued** (submitted but waiting client-side for a concurrency
slot, not yet kicked off) and **Running** (a model run is live).
_Avoid_: in-progress, running [as a top-level state], loading, pending.

**Ready**:
Parsing finished and a result exists, but the user has not yet reviewed and
accepted it. The user must act.
_Avoid_: done (this collides with the backend status — see ambiguities), parsed,
complete, awaiting.

**Done**:
The user **accepted** a Ready Import — its records were committed into the user's
local data. Rendered as checked-off.
_Avoid_: accepted (that is the *action*, below), completed, imported, finished.

**Accept**:
The user action that turns a **Ready** Import into a **Done** one by committing
its parsed records. (**Undo** reverses an Accept, returning the Import to Ready.)

**Reconcile**:
The matching, performed at **Accept** time, of an Import's *new* contacts and
categories against the user's *current* local data — so a person/category already
created by an earlier Import is reused rather than duplicated. Exact name matches
attach automatically; ambiguous ones surface as a warning for the user to resolve.
Necessary because each Import's model-side dedup is frozen at its kickoff and is
blind to Imports accepted later.
_Avoid_: merge (that's the user resolving an ambiguous Reconcile), dedupe (the
model does a different, kickoff-time dedup against `existingContacts`).

## Relationships

- An **Import** moves **Working → Ready → Done**.
- While **Working**, an Import may error and be retried in place (still Working).
- A **Refinement** concerns an existing Import and produces a new parse of the
  same source notes; only **Ready** Imports can be refined.
- **Accept** transitions **Ready → Done**; **Undo** transitions **Done → Ready**.
- A **Summary** labels an Import in the history list regardless of state.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "The user has three Imports in the list — two spinning, one checked
> off. What are their states?"
> **Domain expert:** "The two spinning ones are **Working**. The checked one is
> **Done** — they **Accepted** it. There's a fourth that finished but they
> haven't looked at yet; that one's **Ready**, and it's the one I most want the
> UI to nag about."
> **Dev:** "And if they tweak the Ready one?"
> **Domain expert:** "That's a **Refinement** — same notes, new parse. Still
> Ready afterward, just with a different result."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "in-progress" was used to mean both **Working** and **Ready** — resolved: these
  are distinct states with different durability/resume semantics. "in-progress"
  is retired from the vocabulary.
- "queued" is overloaded: the backend run-status `queued` (`events.ts`) means
  *accepted server-side, model not yet started* — it appears only after a kickoff.
  The user-facing **Queued** sub-state means *not yet kicked off at all* (waiting
  client-side for a concurrency slot). Different things; keep them distinct.
- "done" is overloaded: the backend run-status value `done` means the model
  finished and a result is available — that is the **Ready** state, NOT the
  user-facing **Done** (which requires an **Accept**). When you see `done` in
  `events.ts`/run code, read it as **Ready**.
